1. HCSR04: 
Is the Ultrasonic Sensor used. An ultrasonic sensor contains two circular structures: one is the #transmitter and the other is a #receiver. 
The transmitter transmits the ultrasonic sound while the receiver receives the reflected signal. 
2. Arduino Uno R3: 
The #Arduino is a micro-controller board that is based on the ATmega328P, 
it consists of digital and analog input/output pins that are interfaced with the ultrasonic sensor (used to send and receive data).
the Arduino Uno IDE consists of a Serial Monitor that displays the output.
