Ultrasonic sensor has 4 pins:

1. Vcc: connected to the 5V in Arduino

2. TRIG (trigger): connected to PIN 10 of the Arduino

#Trigger is used as Transmitter, this pin is used to transmit the sound from the Ultrasonic sensor.
Trigger should be high. It is connected to the digital pin of the Arduino and used as output pin. 

3. ECHO: connected to PIN 9 of Arduino.

Echo is used as a Receiver, it receives the sound. 
It is connected to the digital pin of the Arduino and used as input pin. 
In this diagram, we have connected Echo to pin 9.

4. GND (ground): connected to the GND of Arduino
