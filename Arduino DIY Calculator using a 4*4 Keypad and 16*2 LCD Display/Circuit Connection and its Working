Circuit connection involves the following steps:

In the keypad, there are 8 pins in total out of which 4 pins correspond to the Rows 
(viz., R1, R2, R3, R4) and the other four correspond to the Columns (viz., C1, C2, C3, C4). 

These 8 row and column pins of the keypad are connected from 0-7 PWM pins of the Arduino board respectively.

DB 4-DB7 pins of the LCD are connected to 11-8 pins of the Arduino respectively.

The 12th port of the Arduino is connected to Enable pin of the LCD and
the 13th port of the Arduino is connected to Rs of the LCD.

LED 1 of the LCD is connected to the ground pin of the Arduino through a 1-kilo-ohm resistor. 
Further, the Vo and ground pins of the LCD are also connected to the ground pin of the Arduino.

Vo and RW pins of the LCD are shorted (i.e., grounded)

Vcc and the other LED of the LCD are short-circuited and connected to 5V pin of the Arduino
