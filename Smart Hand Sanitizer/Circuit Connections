Connect Vcc of the ultrasonic sensor to 5V of the Arduino via a breadboard.

Connect the ground of the ultrasonic sensor to the ground of the Arduino via a breadboard.

Connect the trigger pin of the ultrasonic sensor to the D7 of the Arduino.

Connect the echo pin of the ultrasonic sensor to D6 of the Arduino.

Connect the ground of the servomotor to the ground rail on the breadboard.

Connect the signal pin of the servomotor to the D5 of the Arduino.
Working:
The connections are made as explained in the "circuit connections" section. 
The distance of the object from the sanitizer outlet is sensed by the ultrasonic sensor. 
The distance value is processed by the code. 
If the object is placed within the set range, 
then the servomotor's shaft is made to rotate thus, dispensing the sanitizer.
