1.Arduino UNO Board.


#Arduino board is a microcontroller that is used to accept inputs from sensors connected and 
provide an output action on the desired device connected to it. 
The sensor inputs can be from light-detecting sensors, motion sensors (Ultrasonic or IR), temperature sensors, etc. 
The output from this device can be received through other output devices such as LED, Buzzer, Serial monitor, etc.

 2.  LM-35 Temperature Sensor

LM-35 #Temperature Sensor gives an analog output based on the instantaneous temperature value.
This analog output is proportional to the instantaneous input.

3. Gas sensor


The gas #sensor is used to measure the concentration or presence of gas in the atmosphere.
It is also used to detect smoke in the air. Based on the gas,
a potential difference is generated by changing the resistance of the material present inside the sensor. 
The output is measure in terms of Voltage.

 4. Resistors



Resistors are passive devices that restrict the flow of current or divide the voltage through the circuit.
The input power passes through these resistors and then to the sensors to avoid damage.

5.  Breadboard


The breadboard is the basic component of any circuit building process. 
All components,  be it input sensors or output display devices are connected to the power supply,
microcontroller using wired connections through a breadboard.
The holes in the breadboard are in series. There are various sizes like full-sized, half-sized, and mini breadboard.

6.  LED

Light Emitting Diode is a commonly used light source.
It is a semiconductor that emits light when current flows through it.

7.  Piezo Buzzer

It is an electrical component that generates a beep sound on receiving an input.
It works on the principle of #piezo crystal.

8. Jumper Wires

These are the main components that are used to establish the connections between different devices of the circuit.
