Anodes of the #LEDs are connected to pin 2, pin3, and pin4 of the Arduino UNO  board respectively.

Cathodes of the LEDs are connected to a 220-ohm resistor which is further connected to the ground of the breadboard.

GND of the IR sensor ( middle terminal ) is connected to the ground of #Arduino UNO.

The power ( third terminal) of the IR #Sensor is connected to the positive power supply ( +5V ) of the Arduino UNO board. 

The output ( first terminal ) of the IR Sensor is connected to Pin12 of the Arduino board.

GND pin of the Arduino board is connected to the GND of the breadboard.


Once the connections are established and code is written in the code section of TinkerCAD,
simulate the circuit design. Now, you are all set to control your LEDs using IR Remote.

IR Remote emits lights in an infrared range that corresponds to specific commands
( power ON / OFF ) while the IR Sensor acts as a receiver that detects and 
decodes the infrared pulses of light then executes the command.  
Blue LED can be controlled by clicking button 1 ( ON ) and 
button 2 (OFF ) of the IR Remote. Orange LED can be controlled 
with the help of Button 3 ( ON ) and Button 4 ( OFF ). Similarly, 
you can control Green LED using Button 5 ( ON ) and Button 6 ( OFF ) respectively.
