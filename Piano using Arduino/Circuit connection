The breadboard is powered using the Arduino.

The positive terminal of the buzzer is connected to 13th pin of the Arduino, negative terminal is connected to the ground.

Connect 8 pushbuttons to digital I/O pins of the Arduino from pin2 to pin9 respectively, they act as tone input pins.

Pull up resistors are connected to the terminals of the pushbuttons and the remaining terminals are grounded.

Working:
After powering and uploading the code into Arduino, 
once we execute the code, our setup will be now ready to test. 
We can press the push buttons to get sound in different frequencies allotted to each of the buttons. 
You can change the frequency of any button 
if required (and it has to be done by specifying the required frequency in the code).
