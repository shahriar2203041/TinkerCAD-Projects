Connect the power pin of the Attiny85 to the positive terminal of the battery.

Connect the ground pin of the Attiny85 to the negative terminal of the battery. 

Likewise, connect the power pin and the ground pin of the TMP36 temperature sensor to the positive and the negative terminal of the battery, respectively. 

Connect the Vout of the TMP36 sensor to the PB2 pin of the Attiny85.

Connect the anode of the LED to the PB0 pin of the Attiny85.

Connect one of the resistor arms to the cathode of the LED. 

Connect the other arm of the resistor to the ground of the Attiny85.

Initialize the PB0 pin to zero and define the PB2 pin.

Declare a variable- realDegree.

In void setup(), set the pin mode for PB0 and initialize the realDegree value to 0.0

In void loop(), the analog values from the sensor are assigned to "degree".
It is divided by 1024 and is assigned to the "realdegree" variable. 

This value will range from 0 to 1, hence it is multiplied by 5 to increase the range.

To get the actual temperature the realdegree value is multiplied by 100.

Convert the degree Celcius value to the Fahrenheit value. 

Using the else-if condition,
for different ranges of the temperature, 
set the LED to blink fast, remain steady, 
blink slowly or turn off by providing suitable delay.
