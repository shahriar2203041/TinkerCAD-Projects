First, it is necessary to define the ground and power supply line of the breadboard.
This is done by connecting the 5V supply pin from the Arduino to one of the lines of the breadboard and
the Ground (GND) pin of the Arduino to another line of pins of the breadboard. In the given circuit diagram, 
the wires in Red are connected to the power supply and those in Green are connected to the Ground.


The LDR has two terminals of which one is directly connected to the Analog pin (A0) of the Arduino and
the same PIN is connected to the ground line of the breadboard through the resistor.
The second pin of the #LDR is connected to the power supply line of the breadboard.


Next, in this circuit, LED is the output device.
So the anode terminal of the LED is connected to the Digital pin (PIN 9) of the Arduino.
The cathode terminal of the #LED is connected to the ground line of the breadboard through the resistor.


We are using Multimeter as the output indicator.
Hence, the pin used for output, i.e. PIN 9 is connected to the positive (RED) terminal of the Multimeter and
the negative (BLACK) terminal of the #multimeter is connected to the ground line of the breadboard.
