Circuit connection involves the following steps :

The circuit connection involves very simple steps. In the keypad, 
there are 8 pins in total out of which 4 pins correspond to the Rows
(viz., R1, R2, R3, R4) and the other four correspond to the Columns (viz., C1, C2, C3, C4). 

The row pins are connected to 9, 8, 7, and 6 Digital pins of the Arduino UNO.

The column pins are connected to 5, 4, 3, and 2 Digital pins of the Arduino UNO.
