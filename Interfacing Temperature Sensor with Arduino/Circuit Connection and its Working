The connection between the Arduino board and LM35- Temperature sensor by using jumper wires involves simple steps:

The supply voltage is the voltage by which the circuit operates, 
and it needs to be connected to 5V on the Arduino board to power the temperature sensor LM35.

The output voltage is the analog pin connected to the A0 pin of the Arduino board through which we receive data.

Finally, connect the ground pin of the sensor to the GND terminal in the Arduino board to establish a common ground connection.
