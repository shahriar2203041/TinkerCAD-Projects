A potentiometer is a variable resistor that is commonly used to adjust voltage levels in circuits. It has three terminals:

VCC (Power Supply) – Connected to 5V (for Arduino).

GND (Ground) – Connected to GND.

Wiper (Middle Pin) – Outputs a variable voltage, connected to an analog input pin on the Arduino.
